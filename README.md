# myD3BarCharts
I have gone through an introduction to data visualisation using D3.js and today I learnt how to plot bar charts. This repository contains my personal practise code.

The data from these charts is gotten from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/babyoda/women-entrepreneurship-and-labor-force)
